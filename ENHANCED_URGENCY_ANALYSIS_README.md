# Enhanced AI-Powered Urgency Analysis System

## Overview

The CrowdCare system now features a comprehensive AI-powered urgency analysis system that accurately determines the urgency level of citizen reports by analyzing multiple factors from both the report content and citizen inputs. This system provides much more precise and effective urgency classification compared to the previous simple model.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Multi-Factor Analysis
The system now analyzes **7 key factors** to determine urgency:

- **Category Analysis** (25% weight): Different issue types have inherent urgency levels
- **Severity Assessment** (20% weight): Citizen-reported severity level
- **Duration Impact** (15% weight): How long the issue has been present
- **Area Impact** (15% weight): Number of people affected
- **Time Context** (10% weight): When the report was submitted (rush hours, night time)
- **Location Context** (10% weight): Urban vs rural areas, high-traffic zones
- **Content Analysis** (5% weight): Keywords indicating urgency in title/description

### 2. Advanced Scoring Algorithm

#### Category Weights
```python
"Traffic Signal": 90,    # Highest priority - safety critical
"Waterlogging": 85,      # High priority - traffic disruption
"Pothole": 80,          # High priority - vehicle damage risk
"Road Issue": 75,       # High priority - infrastructure
"Drainage": 70,         # Medium-high priority
"Streetlight": 60,      # Medium priority - safety concern
"Garbage": 55,          # Medium priority - health/aesthetic
"Sidewalk": 45,         # Lower priority - pedestrian only
"Other": 50            # Default priority
```

#### Severity Multipliers
```python
"Critical": 1.4x       # 40% increase in urgency
"High": 1.2x          # 20% increase in urgency
"Medium": 1.0x        # No change
"Low": 0.8x           # 20% decrease in urgency
```

#### Duration Factors
```python
"Just noticed": 0.9x   # Slightly lower (needs assessment)
"1 day": 1.0x         # Baseline
"1 week": 1.1x        # 10% increase
"2 weeks": 1.2x       # 20% increase
"1 month": 1.3x       # 30% increase
"More than 1 month": 1.4x  # 40% increase (persistent issue)
```

#### Area Impact Factors
```python
"Few people": 0.8x           # 20% decrease
"Many people": 1.1x          # 10% increase
"Entire area": 1.3x          # 30% increase
"Traffic flow": 1.2x         # 20% increase
"Pedestrians only": 0.9x     # 10% decrease
```

### 3. Contextual Analysis

#### Time-Based Urgency
- **Rush Hours** (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM weekdays): 1.2x multiplier
- **Night Time** (10 PM - 6 AM): 1.1x multiplier
- **Weekend Daytime**: 1.0x baseline
- **Weekend Evening/Night**: 1.1x multiplier

#### Location-Based Urgency
- **Urban Areas** (major cities): 1.2x multiplier
- **Rural/Unknown Areas**: 1.0x baseline
- Uses GPS coordinates to detect proximity to major cities

#### Content Analysis
- **Urgent Keywords**: "emergency", "urgent", "dangerous", "hazard", "accident", "injury", "blocked", "flooded", "broken", "damaged", "collapsed", "leaking", "fire", "gas", "electrical", "traffic", "pedestrian", "children"
- **High-Impact Keywords**: "main road", "highway", "school", "hospital", "bridge", "tunnel", "intersection", "crosswalk", "bus stop", "metro", "railway"

### 4. Enhanced Urgency Classification

The system now provides **5 urgency levels** instead of the previous 3:

- **Critical** (90-100): Immediate action required
- **High** (75-89): Urgent attention needed
- **Medium** (50-74): Priority attention required
- **Low** (25-49): Standard maintenance required
- **Very Low** (1-24): Low priority maintenance

### 5. Detailed Reasoning

Each classification includes comprehensive reasoning explaining:
- Why the category has inherent urgency factors
- How severity level affects the score
- Impact of duration on urgency
- Area impact assessment
- Time and location context factors
- Content analysis results
- Final weighted score calculation

## Test Results

The system was tested with 5 different scenarios:

### Test Case 1: Critical Traffic Signal Issue
- **Input**: Broken traffic signal, Critical severity, Traffic flow impact
- **Result**: 100/100 (Critical)
- **Reasoning**: High-priority category + Critical severity + Traffic impact + Urban location + Urgent keywords

### Test Case 2: Low Priority Sidewalk Issue
- **Input**: Minor sidewalk crack, Low severity, Few people affected
- **Result**: 41/100 (Low)
- **Reasoning**: Lower-priority category + Low severity + Limited impact area

### Test Case 3: High Priority Waterlogging
- **Input**: Severe waterlogging, High severity, Entire area affected
- **Result**: 100/100 (Critical)
- **Reasoning**: High-priority category + High severity + Wide area impact + Urban location

### Test Case 4: Medium Priority Pothole
- **Input**: Large pothole, Medium severity, Many people affected, 1 month duration
- **Result**: 100/100 (Critical)
- **Reasoning**: High-priority category + Long duration + Urban location

### Test Case 5: Emergency Streetlight Issue
- **Input**: Downed streetlight near school, High severity, Safety hazard
- **Result**: 94/100 (Critical)
- **Reasoning**: Medium-priority category + High severity + Recent issue + Urban location + Urgent keywords
